Before running script.R you need to change the `path' variable in the script to the path of your local folder.

You can run experiments for different datasets by changing the `data_option' variable.

To replicate Figure 1 in the manuscript, you need to run the script with `data_option' set to `sigmoid-synthetic' and run the script twice: once for `theta_star' with length 10 and another time with length 50. Then simply run plot_synthetic.m in Matlab (or Octave).
